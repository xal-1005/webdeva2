                <h2>Brief History</h2>
                <p>MMA is a full contact combat sport that combines rulesets from many different martial arts. Originally, gimmick fights pitting fighters of different styles against each other (such as Rick Roufus representing Kickboxing against Changpuek Kietsongrit representing Muay Thai) were held and promoted. Many of such fights were held in the 1900s, until an organisation called the Ultimate Fighting Championship was formed and popularised this sport by introducing it to the West. The first ever UFC event was a barbaric tournament style competition that consisted of no rules, a low quality cage, no protective gear and no weight classes. This resulted in some hilarious matchups. After several decades, MMA has evolved to become the sport that we know it as today.</p>

                <h2>Kickboxing</h2>
                <p>A striking style that combines boxing with various kicking techniques. This is an extremely effective style that has taken fighters to championship titles, as it is well-rounded and teaches many ways to defend against most striking styles. Kickboxers are feared for their speed and power. Notable fighters that use Kickboxing include Israel Adesanya and Alex Pereira.</p>

                <h2>Muay Thai</h2>
                <p>The Art of Eight Limbs is one of the most dangerous martial arts in the world, as it nearly maximises every single way the human body can be used as a striking weapon and pushes a fighter's conditioning and pain tolerance to the highest of levels. Similar to kickboxing but with a more fluid stance, Muay Thai adds elbows, knees, and takedowns to their arsenal. Elbows easily slice open skin while knees act as sledgehammers that pound through your opponents. Notable Nak Muay include Suphachai "Saenchai" Saepong, Buakaw Banchamek, and Rodtang Jitmuangnon.</p>

                <h2>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</h2>
                <p>A style that might seem odd to bystanders at first, BJJ is a style that demands respect from anyone who has grappled with an experienced BJJ practitioner. Focusing on takedowns, grappling, submissions, chokeholds, etc., BJJ is a style that allows a lighter opponent to still deal damage to a much heavier opponent. Its practitioners are like human pythons that coil themselves around their opponents and find a windpipe or any joint that can be exploited to inflict excruciating pain. Notable BJJ practitioners include the Gracie Family and Mikey Musumeci.</p>

In just two years, Pereira knocked out ranked contenders and took the Middleweight Title from Adesanya, and then moved up a weight class and won the Light Heavyweight Title. He is one of only three fighters to be inducted into the GLORY Hall of Fame.</p>
